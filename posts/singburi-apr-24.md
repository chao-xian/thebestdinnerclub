Singburi is a special place for this Dinner Club. It's where it all started back in 2022. Back then, it was rumoured to be the best Thai place in London. Since then it's outright topped many best of London lists for great food. Another change since is the epic challenge of getting a table booking!

It took me dozens of phone calls and we've managed 3 visits since that fateful visit in 2022. You basically have to book months ahead! Today's update is for our latest visit.

On our first trip, the staff recommended ordering all the specials to share and that's what we've been doing ever since!

We ordered multiples of a few things, and for the first time ever we had leftovers! Which is no bad thing at all for the lucky folks who took a box home (shout out to homebody Canadians).

The absolute top tier favourite of everyone's is the Moo Krob. This we definitely ordered multiples of every time and it never seems to not be on the specials menu.

I pray we get to go again this year... If not I kinda know the hacks to get a table for next year ðŸ¥²
