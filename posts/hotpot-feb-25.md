Last year I hosted my first hotpot attempt, and one and only dinner at mine. It was so wholesome I needed to do it again for 2025 CNY which was happened to be closer to Valentine's Day. A perfect time for a Palentine Dinner with 3 of my bestest pals.

It turned out to be a more intimate number this year and that made it a lot more chill thankfully. I'm always a bit anxious and overwhelmed with making food for people. Hotpot was easy enough last year and this time was ok too. Mostly. The rice noodles sticking to the bottom and running low on broth was not the one.

We had wonderful chats. I got some nice compliments about my newly acquired (very) vintage Togo. As you can see, Beth found it very cosy.

I sent all 3 of them home with takeaway boxes including extra dessert. It felt quite a success! I am so so honoured and appreciative of these three wonderful people making the effort to come all the way from North London to my place down in South East. I hope to keep up the tradition of Hotpot!
